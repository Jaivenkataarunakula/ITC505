            <h2>Addendum: Stylistic Choices</h2>
            <p>
                In styling this resume, I aimed for clarity, professionalism, and readability through the following CSS choices:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Font Choices:</strong> I selected Times New Roman as the primary font for its classic and professional appearance, supplemented by serif as a fallback for better readability on screens.</li>
                <li><strong>Heading Sizes:</strong> Headings are appropriately sized to create a hierarchy, with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> used exclusively for the main title (name) and subsequent levels adjusted accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Choices:</strong> Used a muted color palette with #2c3e50 for headings to maintain a professional yet accessible look.</li>
                <li><strong>Margin and Padding:</strong> Applied consistent margins and paddings to sections to improve readability and visual separation, with headings having slightly larger margins to distinguish sections.</li>
                <li><strong>Border and Divider:</strong> Used a subtle bottom border for sections to visually separate content without overwhelming the reader.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These choices aim to present information clearly while ensuring the resume remains visually appealing and easy to navigate.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>HTML Abuse:</em> Ensured h1 tag is used exclusively for the main title (Jai Venkata Arun Akula) instead of using a different heading level based on visual appearance.
            </p>
            <p>Corrected any misuse of HTML elements solely based on visual appearance, ensuring each element (h1, h2, etc.) reflects its semantic meaning in the document structure.</p>
