    <h1>Addendum</h1>
    <p>Process and Elemenst What I have used</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            volume: These are boolean variables used to control certain features like volume.
        </li>
        <li>
            $drone: These are jQuery objects representing elements with IDs drone. It is likely used for controlling audio of the game.
        </li>
        <li>
            square: This function defines an object representing a square shape and its properties and methods.
        </li>
        <li>
            lightsOut: This function initializes and controls the Lights Out game, including grid generation, toggling squares, checking for a win condition, and resetting the game.
        </li>
        <li>
            Also Added event listeners to the various elements in document and execute functions when clicked. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Raphael: This is a library for creating vector graphics using JavaScript. This helped me to draw and manipulate shapes on an SVG canvas.
        </li>
        <li>
            These are functions provided by external libraries like jQuery ($(document).ready(), $(document).on()) and JavaScript (setTimeout(), clearTimeout(), Math.floor(), Math.random()).
        </li>
        <li>
            These are functions and properties associated with the objects created in the code, like publicSetHeight, toggleSquare, and many more.
        </li>
        <li>
            DOM Manupulation methods are used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), such as showing/hiding elements, changing CSS classes, updating HTML content.
        </li>
        <li>
            console.log(): This method is used for debugging purposes, printing messages to the browser console.
        </li>
        <li>
            The challenges I faced are while adding the click sound it should toogle soudn whenever we click squares. So only i applied sound to toggling function.
        </li>
        <li>
            For uniqueness, I have used color and opacity in js script where unit color and strke color define square color and Off opacity and on opacity will 
            will determin the opacity of square when its active and inactive.
        </li>
        <li>
            And Also the title animation enhanced with time with fade-out and fade-in for visual enhancements.
        </li>
        <li>
            The reset and  sound symbols are also handled for extra embedded elements.
        </li>
        <li>
            I have also added timer functionality and the timer only starts when any square is toggled and once the game is completed, it resets the game logic along with the timer.
        </li>
    </ol>
