        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>This HTML document presents a polished resume for Jai Venkata Arun AKula. The header dynamically displays his name without any effects. Each resume section, including Objective, Education, Skill Set, Work Experience, Certifications, Personal Details, and Declaration, is elegantly defined. While JavaScript dynamically updates the footer with the last modified date and time, adding a sophisticated touch. I host this webpage through github.
